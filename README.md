# Quinnipiac-Atmospheric-Model

## About This Project

This repo is for the work I completed for my senior research as a biochemistry major at Quinnipiac University. Utlizing the framework for atmospheric modeling
(https://github.com/AirChem/F0AM), measurements of atmospheric chemical concentrations/meteorological conditions made on campus, and a few different methods
of estimation for certain key values, the production of ozone on campus was modeled.

For a more detailed explanation of this project, I suggest reading the "Senior-Research-Report" word document I have in this repo, which is the final report
I turned in for my research, written in the style of a Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry pre-print publication.


## About This Repo

The "MySetupsAndScripts" file contains the code I completed for this project while the "F0AM-Framework" folder contains the model framework written by Glenn Wolfe.
The original readme file and supporting documents are within the folder in the repo, and also available at F0AMs actgual repo, linked in the section above.
